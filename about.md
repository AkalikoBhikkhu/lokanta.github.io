So here we are in Harris Park. Ven Sujato and Ven Akaliko, two monks from the forest tradition. I’ve lived in the forest for nearly 25 years, and now I’m not. We’re in a small 2 bedroom flat, and what do you know? I like it! It’s simple and easy.

We want to make this a place we can practice and grow in our monastic life, while serving the Buddhist community.

Many times, when living in conventional monasteries, life is very beautiful, and the place is a delight and a refuge for many people. But there is also a cost, one that is not so obvious. Living in the forest, especially in modern times, takes a lot of time and effort and funding. At this time in my life, I want to put my main efforts into SuttaCentral.

We’re looking to keep the good traditions of Buddhist monastic life. We go for alms-round (*piṇḍapāta*) each day, accepting invitations to eat in houses only on the weekends. As far as possible, all the furnishings are second-hand, maintaining the *paṁsukula* tradition, of using robes from the rubbish heap. We will not accumulate belongings here, remembering that it is all impermanent, and we will be moving on.

We have a lot of ideas for the coming weeks and months. We’ll be using this blog as a primary web hub, so check back in to see what we’re up to.
